Welcome to the Undocumented Windows NT CD-ROM!

The CD-ROM that accompanies this book contains the source code and binaries for all the sample applications that we've discussed in this book. Each sample is kept in a separate directory. 

To try out each sample, open the accompanying README.TXT file. Each contains step-by-step instructions for installing and trying out the sample. 

In each README.TXT file, we have also identified which system (or systems) we used to test the sample - Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4, and/or Windows 2000 beta 1 and beta 2.
